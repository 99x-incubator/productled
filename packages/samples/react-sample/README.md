# Productled sample React application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a simple React application that demonstrates how to use the `@productled/activation' library.

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will be able to see a 'spotlight' on the page 'SubPage'. This is a simple example of how you can use the `@productled/activation` library to show a spotlight on a specific element on the screen.
